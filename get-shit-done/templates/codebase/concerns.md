# Codebase Concerns

**Analysis Date:** 2025-01-20

## Tech Debt

**Database queries in React components:**
- Issue: Direct Supabase queries in 15+ page components instead of server actions
- Files: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/profile/page.tsx`, `app/courses/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/settings/page.tsx` (and 11 more in `app/`)
- Why: Rapid prototyping during MVP phase
- Impact: Can't implement RLS properly, exposes DB structure to client
- Fix approach: Move all queries to server actions in `app/actions/`, add proper RLS policies

**Manual webhook signature validation:**
- Issue: Copy-pasted Stripe webhook verification code in 3 different endpoints
- Files: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/checkout/route.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/subscription/route.ts`
- Why: Each webhook added ad-hoc without abstraction
- Impact: Easy to miss verification in new webhooks (security risk)
- Fix approach: Create shared `lib/stripe/validate-webhook.ts` middleware

## Known Bugs

**Race condition in subscription updates:**
- Symptoms: User shows as "free" tier for 5-10 seconds after successful payment
- Trigger: Fast navigation after Stripe checkout redirect, before webhook processes
- Files: `app/checkout/success/page.tsx` (redirect handler), `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` (webhook)
- Workaround: Stripe webhook eventually updates status (self-heals)
- Root cause: Webhook processing slower than user navigation, no optimistic UI update
- Fix: Add polling in `app/checkout/success/page.tsx` after redirect

## Security Considerations

**Admin role check client-side only:**
- Risk: Admin dashboard pages check isAdmin from Supabase client, no server verification
- Files: `app/admin/page.tsx`, `app/admin/users/page.tsx`, `components/AdminGuard.tsx`
- Current mitigation: None (relying on UI hiding)
- Recommendations: Add middleware to admin routes in `middleware.ts`, verify role server-side

## Performance Bottlenecks

**/api/courses endpoint:**
- Problem: Fetching all courses with nested lessons and authors
- File: `app/api/courses/route.ts`
- Measurement: 1.2s p95 response time with 50+ courses
- Cause: N+1 query pattern (separate query per course for lessons)
- Improvement path: Use Prisma include to eager-load lessons in `lib/db/courses.ts`, add Redis caching

## Fragile Areas

**Authentication middleware chain:**
- File: `middleware.ts`
- Why fragile: 4 different middleware functions run in specific order (auth -> role -> subscription -> logging)
- Common failures: Middleware order change breaks everything, hard to debug
- Safe modification: Add tests before changing order, document dependencies in comments
- Test coverage: No integration tests for middleware chain (only unit tests)

## Scaling Limits

**Supabase Free Tier:**
- Current capacity: 500MB database, 1GB file storage, 2GB bandwidth/month
- Limit: ~5000 users estimated before hitting limits
- Symptoms at limit: 429 rate limit errors, DB writes fail
- Scaling path: Upgrade to Pro ($25/mo) extends to 8GB DB, 100GB storage

## Dependencies at Risk

**react-hot-toast:**
- Risk: Unmaintained (last update 18 months ago), React 19 compatibility unknown
- Impact: Toast notifications break, no graceful degradation
- Migration plan: Switch to sonner (actively maintained, similar API)

## Missing Critical Features

**Payment failure handling:**
- Problem: No retry mechanism or user notification when subscription payment fails
- Current workaround: Users manually re-enter payment info (if they notice)
- Blocks: Can't retain users with expired cards, no dunning process
- Implementation complexity: Medium (Stripe webhooks + email flow + UI)

## Test Coverage Gaps

**Payment flow end-to-end:**
- What's not tested: Full Stripe checkout -> webhook -> subscription activation flow
- Risk: Payment processing could break silently (has happened twice)
- Priority: High
- Difficulty to test: Need Stripe test fixtures and webhook simulation setup

<guidelines>

**What belongs in codebase concerns:**
- Tech debt with clear impact and fix approach
- Known bugs with reproduction steps
- Security gaps and mitigation recommendations
- Performance bottlenecks with measurements
- Fragile code that breaks easily
- Scaling limits with numbers
- Dependencies that need attention
- Missing features that block workflows
- Test coverage gaps

**What does NOT belong here:**
- Opinions without evidence ("code is messy")
- Complaints without solutions ("auth sucks")
- Future feature ideas (that's for product planning)
- Normal TODOs (those live in code comments)
- Architectural decisions that are working fine
- Minor code style issues

**When filling this template:**
- **Always include file paths** - Concerns without locations are not actionable. Use backticks: `src/file.ts`
- Be specific with measurements ("500ms p95" not "slow")
- Include reproduction steps for bugs
- Suggest fix approaches, not just problems
- Focus on actionable items
- Prioritize by risk/impact
- Update as issues get resolved
- Add new concerns as discovered

**Tone guidelines:**
- Professional, not emotional ("N+1 query pattern" not "terrible queries")
- Solution-oriented ("Fix: add index" not "needs fixing")
- Risk-focused ("Could expose user data" not "security is bad")
- Factual ("3.5s load time" not "really slow")

**Useful for phase planning when:**
- Deciding what to work on next
- Estimating risk of changes
- Understanding where to be careful
- Prioritizing improvements
- Onboarding new Claude contexts
- Planning refactoring work

**How this gets populated:**
Explore agents detect these during codebase mapping. Manual additions welcome for human-discovered issues. This is living documentation, not a complaint list.

<mosic_operations>

**Create codebase concerns page:**
```javascript
await mosic_create_entity_page("MProject", project_id, {
  title: "Codebase Concerns",
  icon: "lucide:alert-circle",
  content: concernsContent,
  page_type: "Document"
});

await mosic_batch_add_tags_to_document("M Page", page_id, {
  workspace_id,
  tags: ["gsd-managed", "codebase", "concerns"]
});
```

**Read concerns for planning:**
```javascript
const pages = await mosic_get_entity_pages("MProject", project_id);
const concerns = pages.find(p => p.title === "Codebase Concerns");
const content = await mosic_get_page(concerns.name, { content_format: "markdown" });
```

**Update concerns analysis:**
```javascript
await mosic_update_content_blocks(page_id, {
  blocks: updatedContent
});
```

**Find all codebase concerns pages:**
```javascript
const concernPages = await mosic_search_documents_by_tags({
  workspace_id,
  tags: ["codebase", "concerns"],
  doctype: "M Page"
});
```
