<guidelines>

**Core Technologies:**
- Include specific version numbers
- Explain why this is the standard choice, not just what it does
- Focus on technologies that affect architecture decisions

**Supporting Libraries:**
- Include libraries commonly needed for this domain
- Note when each is needed (not all projects need all libraries)

**Alternatives:**
- Don't just dismiss alternatives
- Explain when alternatives make sense
- Helps user make informed decisions if they disagree

**What NOT to Use:**
- Actively warn against outdated or problematic choices
- Explain the specific problem, not just "it's old"
- Provide the recommended alternative

**Version Compatibility:**
- Note any known compatibility issues
- Critical for avoiding debugging time later

</guidelines>

<mosic_operations>

**Create stack research page:**
```javascript
await mosic_create_entity_page("MProject", project_id, {
  title: "Stack Research",
  icon: "lucide:layers",
  content: stackContent,
  page_type: "Document"
});

await mosic_batch_add_tags_to_document("M Page", page_id, {
  workspace_id,
  tags: ["gsd-managed", "research-project", "stack"]
});
```

**Read stack for planning:**
```javascript
const pages = await mosic_get_entity_pages("MProject", project_id);
const stack = pages.find(p => p.title === "Stack Research");
const content = await mosic_get_page(stack.name, { content_format: "markdown" });
```

**Update stack research:**
```javascript
await mosic_update_content_blocks(page_id, {
  blocks: updatedContent
});
```

**Find all stack research:**
```javascript
const stackPages = await mosic_search_documents_by_tags({
  workspace_id,
  tags: ["research-project", "stack"],
  doctype: "M Page"
});
```
